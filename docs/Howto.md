How to Use LNVL
===============

This documents explains how to use LNVL: the LÖVE Visual Novel engine.
It is a tutorial and a guide for users wanting to use LNVL to create
their own stories.  This document assumes you can run LNVL and are
comfortable writing scripts with a text editor of your choice, but
makes no other assumptions about your knowledge of scripting or
programming languages.  The document will sometimes refer to the
reader as the *author.*


The Bird’s-Eye View of LNVL
---------------------------

You use LNVL as the author by writing *scripts.*  These are files that
do things like:

1. Describe scenes for action to take place.
2. Create characters to interact with each other.
3. Provide the dialog and narration for your story.
4. Present options to the reader so he can make choices affecting the
story on a scale that you control.

LNVL scripts are plain text files; you can write them with any text
editor.  But the scripts use their own special language.  This
language provides ways for you to do all of the things listed above.
Here is a simple example:

```lua
Lobby = LNVL.Character:new{name="Lobby Jones", image="images/Lobby.png"}

START = LNVL.Scene:new{
    Lobby "Hello everyone!",
    Lobby "My name is Lobby Jones.",
    Lobby "And this is my short introduction.",
    Lobby "Now goodbye to you!"
}
```

This script creates one character, Lobby Jones, and one scene.  All of
the action in LNVL takes place within scenes, so every script must
define at least one scene.  The action always begins with the `START`
scene, so that is the one we create.  And within that scene we have
our Lobby character speak four lines of dialog.  The user would see
these lines one-by-one and could navigate back and forth between them
at his leisure.

Computer programmers may recognize this language is actually the
[Lua programming language][lua].  That is true.  The special language
LNVL provides is [domain-specific language][dsl] (DSL) written in
Lua.  This DSL makes it easier to write scripts for LNVL, but it also
means that, if necessary, authors have the full power of the Lua
programming language at their disposal.
