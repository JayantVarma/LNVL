LNVL
====

LNVL implements a simple [visual novel][nvl] component for use in
games based on the [LÖVE engine][love].  LNVL provides only basic
functionality and works best as an addition to another program which
provides actual gameplay.  The great [Ren’Py][renpy] engine is the
main inspiration for LNVL, but this project does not attempt to be an
all-encompassing visual novel engine like Ren’Py.
